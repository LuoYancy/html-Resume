        Let me share a bit about how I enjoy life outside of coding:
    </p>

    <h2>🚴‍♂️ Active Hobbies:</h2>
    <p>I love staying energized and connected to nature. One of my favorite activities is hiking—whether it’s a local trail or a challenging mountain climb, I enjoy the fresh air and the sense of accomplishment after every hike.</p>

    <h2>📚 Chill Hobbies:</h2>
    <p>When I need to slow down and recharge, you’ll often find me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Listening to music</li>
        <li>Reading books</li>
        <li>Watching movies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These quiet moments help me relax, reflect, and get inspired.</p>

    <h2>🌹Closing line idea:</h2>
    <p>Life is all about balance—staying active and finding stillness. Thanks for stopping by and getting to know me a little better!</p>
